## General

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **App language** | Türkçe | English, Türkçe, Deutsch, Español, 繁體中文. The app reloads when you change it. |
| **Start page** | Overview | Which tab opens on launch. |
| **Interface density** | Comfortable | Compact reduces row height, fitting about a third more rows per screen. |
| **Time format** | 24-hour | Applies to session timers, log timestamps and quiet hours. |
| **Start with Windows** | Off | Launches SteamEdge at login, silently into the tray. |
| **Minimise to tray on close** | Off | Closing the window keeps farming running in the background. |
| **Prevent sleep** | Off | Stops the PC sleeping and the screen locking while farming or boosting. |
| **Start with the sidebar collapsed** | Off | Icon-only sidebar; the content area gains 128 pixels. |

### Backup

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Export / Import** | - | Writes all preferences and lifetime statistics to one `.json`. **Login tokens and saved accounts are deliberately excluded**, so the file is safe to store in the cloud. |
| **How long remembered data is kept** | 90 days | Applies to queue order, removed games and the achievement log. Expired entries are deleted at startup. Your settings are not affected. |

### Danger zone

**Delete all data** removes session, saved accounts, settings, statistics and price cache,
then returns to the login screen. Your Steam account is untouched. Two confirmations
required.

## Card Farming

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Default priority mode** | Sequential | Which mode the Card Farming tab opens with. |
| **Default queue order** | Default | Which column the queue is sorted by on open. |
| **Max games at once** | 10 | How many games count as running simultaneously. The known Steam client limit is 32 - this is server-side behaviour, not a limit in this app. Lower values use fewer resources. |
| **Max time per game** | 5 min | When this elapses the queue moves on even if no card dropped. `0` disables the limit. |
| **Retry after error** | 3 | How many times a dropped Steam connection is retried. The delay doubles each attempt. |
| **Reconnect automatically** | On | Restores the session after an internet or Steam outage and resumes the queue. |
| **Move to the next game when cards run out** | On | Off means you start each game manually. |

### Automation

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-list on the market** | Off | Lists newly dropped cards at the average price. **Changes your account permanently** - off by default. |
| **Farm in the background** | Off | Skips per-second interface redraws while the window is hidden. The engine is unaffected. |
| **Unlock achievements while hours accrue** | Off | Unlocks locked achievements at intervals during farming. **Changes your account permanently.** |
| **Notify on card drop** | Off | Desktop notification for every card. |

## Market

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Default selling price** | Average | The starting strategy for the sell bar: average, undercut, match lowest, sell instantly, or custom. |
| **Undercut amount** | 1 cent | How far below the cheapest listing "Undercut" goes. Small protects profit, large sells faster. |
| **Max items per bulk sale** | 50 | Higher values can trigger a temporary restriction on Steam's side. |
| **Order book depth** | 5 | How many price levels the detail panel lists. |
| **Price refresh interval** | 15 min | How often prices re-fetch while the Inventory tab is open. |
| **Refresh prices automatically** | Off | Enables the interval above. |
| **Ask for confirmation before selling** | On | Shows item count, gross and net before listing. |
| **Two-step confirmation when selling** | Off | Requires the Steam Guard mobile code for bulk sales. |
| **Price drop alert** | Off | Notifies when an item falls below its recent median. |

> **Prices always match Steam.** There is no currency conversion and no fee deduction in
> the list columns. The amount shown is exactly the amount on the Steam market page. The
> net figure - what reaches your wallet after Steam's cut - is shown separately in the
> selling flow.

## Inventory

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Default sorting** | By value | Which column the table opens sorted by. |
| **Double-click action** | Open details | What double-clicking an item does. "Sell instantly" skips confirmation - be careful. |
| **Low-value threshold** | 1 | Items below this are dimmed so they stand out during bulk selection. |
| **Hide items that cannot be sold** | Off | Removes coupons, gifts and non-tradable items. |
| **Hide sold items** | On | Listed items move to Pending so you do not list them twice. |
| **Group by game** | Off | Opens with grouping enabled. |
| **Compact rows** | Off | Row height 60 → 40 pixels. |

---

## Hour Booster

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Default target duration** | 1 hour | The duration the tab opens with. Unlimited runs until you stop it. |
| **Max games at once** | 32 | The known limit. Steam does not count time for games beyond it. |
| **Game start interval** | 5 s | Games start one by one at this spacing rather than all at once. |
| **Remember the game list** | On | Your selection is restored next launch. |
| **Stop automatically when the time is up** | On | Off keeps games open past the target. |
| **Shuffle the game order** | Off | Different order each session, spreading hours evenly. |
| **Pause farming while boosting** | Off | Avoids running both engines against Steam at once. |

### Hour sync

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Sync playtimes** | **Off** | Levels the total playtime of selected games in stages. See [Tutorial](./TUTORIAL.md#hour-sync). |
| **Target** | Highest of the selected | Or manually entered hours, or the highest in your whole library. |
| **Manual target hours** | 100 | Only used when the target is "Manually entered hours". |

---

## Achievements

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Unlock interval** | 1 second | The wait between two unlocks. The real delay varies randomly around it (±40%) so no fixed rhythm forms. Longer options go up to 90 minutes. |
| **Default sorting** | Default | Rarity sorting puts the least-unlocked achievements first. |
| **Safe mode** | On | Unlocks one at a time using the interval. Leave it on. |
| **Spread unlocks over time** | Off | Much wider randomisation - looks natural, takes far longer. |
| **Ask for confirmation on single changes** | On | Off lets you toggle instantly with a double-click. |
| **I ticked "do not ask again"** | Off | Appears here if you dismissed the confirmation dialog. Turn it off to bring the dialog back. |

> Unlocking achievements changes your Steam account permanently. Re-locking is possible,
> but the original unlock date cannot be restored.

---

## Notifications

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Show desktop notifications** | On | Master switch. Off silences everything below; in-app records continue. |
| **Card farming started / stopped** | On | Includes the card count. |
| **Hour boosting started / stopped** | On | Start, target reached, and stop. |
| **When an achievement unlocks** | On | |
| **When an error occurs** | On | Connection drops, rejected logins, sale failures. Not recommended to disable. |
| **Notification sound** | Chime | 23 sounds, all generated in-app - no files, no licensing issues. Selecting one plays it. |
| **Quiet hours** | Off | No notifications in the range you set, errors included. |

### Steam chat

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Notify me on new messages** | On | Friends messaging you on Steam reach you even while the app runs in the background. |
| **Send an automatic reply** | Off | Auto-replies to whoever messages you. |
| **Automatic reply text** | *(a short away message)* | Leave empty to disable. |
| **Cooldown before replying again** | 1 hour | Prevents spamming someone who writes repeatedly. |

---

## Privacy & security

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Appear offline** | Off | Friends do not see you playing; activity is not published to your profile. |
| **Hide the game name** | Off | You appear online, but which game is running stays hidden. |
| **Session timeout** | Never | Signs out after this much inactivity. Active farming or boosting resets the timer. |
| **Two-step confirmation when selling** | Off | Steam Guard code for bulk sales. Protects your inventory if the account is compromised. |

---

## Statistics

Lifetime totals: runtime, cards dropped, cards sold, boost time, best day, average sale,
and when tracking started. **Reset statistics** clears them.

> XP and badge counts are not tracked - Steam does not expose them to headless access.
> Card, sale and time figures are real measurements.

---

## Advanced & data

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Log level** | Errors only | Verbose noticeably increases disk usage. Use it only while troubleshooting. |
| **Keep debug logs** | Off | Writes all protocol traffic to `cache/steamedge.log`. Attach it to bug reports. |
| **Hardware acceleration** | On | Turn off and restart if you see graphical glitches or freezes. |
| **API request interval** | 350 ms | Minimum gap between Steam requests. Below 350 ms risks a temporary rate limit. |
| **Open data folder** | - | Opens the folder holding `settings/` and `cache/`. |
| **Clear price cache** | - | Forces all prices to refetch. |
