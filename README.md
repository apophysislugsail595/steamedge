## What it is

SteamEdge is a desktop app that talks to Steam over its own network protocol. It signs in
with your account, reports games as "being played", and collects the trading cards Steam
drops for them. The Steam client never has to be open, no game is ever downloaded or
launched, and nothing is injected into any process.

It also boosts playtime hours, unlocks or locks achievements, and reads real Community
Market data so you can price and sell your cards without leaving the app.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Card farming** | Five modes: sequential, most cards, fewest cards, custom priority, and a Fast mode that understands Steam's 2-hour rule. |
| **Multiple accounts** | Sign in to several accounts at once. They farm in parallel in the background; the window shows whichever you switch to. |
| **Hour booster** | Keep up to 32 games open at once. Optional **hour sync** levels different playtimes to the same total, stage by stage. |
| **Achievements** | Read the real unlock state over the protocol, unlock or lock in bulk, with safe-mode pacing and randomised intervals. |
| **Inventory & Market** | Real order book (current listings + buy orders) and real sale history. Item value comes from **completed sales**, never from a single inflated listing. |
| **No Steam client** | Everything runs over the Steam network protocol. No game files, no overlay, no injection. |
| **Portable** | Unzip and run. Settings and cache live next to the executable; nothing is written to the registry. |
| **5 languages** | English, Türkçe, Deutsch, Español, 繁體中文. |

## Quick start

1. Download the latest `SteamEdge-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Miabeyefendi/steamedge/releases/latest).
2. Extract it anywhere (Desktop, USB stick, anywhere you can write to).
3. Run `SteamEdge.exe`.
4. Scan the QR code with the Steam mobile app, or sign in with your username and password.
5. Open **Card Farming** and press **Start**.

Full walkthrough with screenshots: [Setup guide](./docs/en/SETUP.md).

## How it compares

| | SteamEdge | Idle Master | ArchiSteamFarm |
|---|---|---|---|
| Steam client required | No | Yes | No |
| Multiple accounts at once | Yes | No | Yes |
| Graphical interface | Yes | Yes | Web UI |
| Hour boosting | Yes | No | No |
| Achievement manager | Yes | No | No |
| Market selling built in | Yes | No | No |
| Portable (no install) | Yes | Yes | Yes |

This table is about scope, not quality. ArchiSteamFarm is a far more mature project and is
the better choice for large-scale, headless, multi-account farming. SteamEdge aims at a
single desktop user who wants farming, hours, achievements and selling in one window.

## How it works

Steam only drops trading cards for a game once its total playtime passes **2 hours**.
SteamEdge sends the same `ClientGamesPlayed` message the real Steam client sends, so Steam
counts the time and drops cards normally.

- **Fast mode** first brings every game under 2 hours up to the threshold - in parallel,
  because Steam accrues time for every game that is open at once - then keeps them all
  open and rotates the highlighted game every 1.5-2 minutes.
- **Item value** is the quantity-weighted median of *completed sales* from Steam's price
  history. Current listings are shown separately and never feed the value, because a
  single seller listing one item at $999,999 must not move it.
- **Prices are fetched in your own wallet currency**, read from the Steam Community
  Market, and displayed in exactly that currency. There is no conversion anywhere.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- A Steam account (Steam Guard mobile authenticator recommended)
- An internet connection

Nothing else. No .NET, no Node.js, no Steam client.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Miabeyefendi/steamedge.git
cd SteamEdge
npm install
npm start          # run in development
npm run build      # produce a portable build in ../Release Vx.y.z
```

Requires Node.js 20 or newer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Is it safe?

Read [FAQ.md](./docs/en/FAQ.md) before you decide. The short version:

- SteamEdge only sends messages the official Steam client also sends. It does not modify
  game files, does not use the Steam Web API key, and does not touch other players.
- Your password is never stored. Steam issues a refresh token; that token is kept in
  `settings/` next to the executable. Treat that folder like a password.
- Unlocking hundreds of achievements in seconds is visible on your public profile. Safe
  mode exists for a reason - leave it on.
- Automating your account is against Steam's Subscriber Agreement. Nobody can promise you
  will not be actioned. You accept that risk yourself.

## Credits

SteamEdge is an independent application written from scratch. **No code was taken** from
the projects below; each was studied to understand how Steam works, and the problems they
solved and the approaches they chose gave us ideas.

| Project | What we learned from it | Author |
|---|---|---|
| [Idle Master](https://github.com/jshackles/idle_master) | The core idea: cards can be farmed without a Steam client, by reporting a game as "being played". | [@jshackles](https://github.com/jshackles) |
| [Idle Master Extended](https://github.com/JonasNilson/idle_master_extended) | What changed on Steam's side after the original was archived, and which settings are worth exposing. | [@JonasNilson](https://github.com/JonasNilson) |
| [HourBoostr](https://github.com/ezzpify/HourBoostr) | That several games can be held open at once, and what that means for playtime accrual. | [@ezzpify](https://github.com/ezzpify) |
| [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) | That achievements can be read and changed without launching the game. | [@gibbed](https://github.com/gibbed) |
| [ArchiSteamFarm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm) | Keeping a long-running headless Steam session healthy, maFile usage, and running several accounts at once. | [@JustArchi](https://github.com/JustArchi) |

The part of the app that talks to Steam uses the open-source
[steam-user](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user),
[steam-session](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-session),
[steam-totp](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-totp) and
[qrcode](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode) packages by
[@DoctorMcKay](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay) and contributors. All other code belongs to
SteamEdge.
